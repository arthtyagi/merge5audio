## How to use the GUI?

## What does this entail?

I did this project for a client recently. I was supposed to make a simple command-line utility but I was like, why tf not make a simple GUI along with it too. Anyhoo, I found audio manipulation cool plus it doesn't hurt that I know a thing or two about sound engineering and music production which leads me to my new project, [TRILL AUDIO](https://github.com/arthtyagi/trillaudio).
